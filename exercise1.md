In the scenario we are picking ‘Python’ as the programming language. For linting ‘Pylint’ can be used. Some other linters: Flake8, Pylama, pycodestyle, pydocstyle and so on. For testing, the pytest framework can be used. Some other options: unittest, Python Behave, Python Gauge, Python Lettuce, Python Jasmine, Python Locust and so on. For building, ‘PyBuilder’ can be used. Other options are: Buildout, microbuild, Paver, pynt and so on.

Some alternatives of Jenkins and GithubActions: CircleCI, Bitrise, Gitlab, AWS CodePipeline, Travis CI, Buddy, Buildbot, Drone.io and so on.

It seems this setup is better hosted in a cloud based environment. There exist github actions for pybuilder, pytest and pylint. Since all of them are available in one place and the project is not large in scale, GitHub Actions can be a good enough CI/CD platform for this particular project. The availability of the needed tools and scale of the project are the information that were taken into account for the selection of the CI/CD platform. Other factors to consider would be maintenance of the CI/CD system. Self hosting would require a lot of effort from the developer’s side to maintain the pipeline. Security is another factor. Using a third party platform means compromising the security of sensitive data which would not happen in case of self hosting CI/CD system.
